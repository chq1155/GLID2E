# GLID$^2$E: Lightweight Policy-Based Fine-Tuning for Discrete Diffusion in Biological Sequence Design

The repository contains the code for the `GLID2E` method presented in the paper: *[GLID2E: Lightweight Policy-Based Fine-Tuning for
Discrete Diffusion in Biological Sequence Design](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/poster/119469)(2025)*.
`GLID2E` is a fine-tuning method for reward optimization or alignment in discrete diffusion models, employing a reinforcement learning approach to fine-tune pretrained discrete diffusion models for generating functional biological sequence.

## Regulatory DNA Sequence Design

Our goal here is to optimize the activity of regulatory DNA sequences such that they drive gene expression in specific cell types, a critical task for cell and gene therapy. The detailed code and instructions are in `drakes_dna/`. 

## Protein Sequence Design: Optimizing Stability in Inverse Folding Model

Given a pretrained inverse folding model that generates sequences conditioned on the
backboneâ€™s conformation (3D structure), our goal is to optimize the stability of these generated sequences.  The illustrative figure is as follows. The code and instructions are in `drakes_protein/`.
